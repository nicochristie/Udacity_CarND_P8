# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Project Analysis
A fairly straight-forward project, the key concept is to understand the impact of parameter tuning, and how it will affect reaction times on the car's driving. A slow reaction could yield to driving offroad on a hard turn, a fast reaction could lead to overshooting and oscillations.

### Side note
A lot of time was invested in fine tuning parameters, and the Workspace wasn't exactly collaborative on this, since constant switching between Standard and GPU mode was necessary to compile in one and simulate on the other one. I would strongly recommend investing a few more minutes/hours in a local development environment.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.
